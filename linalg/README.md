This sub-package of BlueMath library implements Linear Algebra routines.

It is implemented on top of LAPACK library compiled to Javascript using
Emscripten.

* Low level access to LAPACK routines (BLAS 1,2,3 and higher level
LAPACK routines).
* Higher level Linear Algebra API, e.g. solution of linear equation
systems - solve, Least squares - lstsq, Decompositions - svd, qr,
cholesky, Eigen value calculations)
